# Automatic MRBS reminder e-mails, GPLv4, created by anselm at hoffmeister dot be, modified by carmean at sfu dot ca with help from others including Anselm, 
# updated for weekly reminders of all the bookings for the coming week by klaasschoutteten at gmail dot com with help from Anselm.
# See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=25430126 for more information.  
# The following script is written to work with the 'db_ext' auth method, on condition that the external users database is actually the same one as the MRBS database...
# As db_ext, I installed the following registration system: http://daveismyname.com/login-and-registration-system-with-php-bp . MRBS was v1.4.11.
# The registration system allows people to register an account, and can easily be configured to work within MRBS. It uses crypt password hashing format. 
# The users are stored in the same MySQL database as the MRBS MySQL database, but in a MySQL table called members (rather than mrbs_users for the 'db' auth option).
# If you want this script to run with the 'db' auth option, you will have to change m.username, m.email, and members m to u.name, u.email and mrbs_users u respectively in $s on lines 42, 43, 45 and 49.
# You can test this code by running it from the website (e.g., the filename was emailreminders-final.php, and I ran it by (re)loading http://www.your.website.address/mrbs/emailreminders-final.php) ,
# but made it so all e-mails went to me (line 29) so that others would not be bothered.
# To run this script weekly, link it to a cron job which runs weekly at e.g. Monday 5 am (choose a time not interfering with daylight saving time changes)
# The code for a weekly cronjob at Monday 5 am is: 0 5 * * 1 wget â€“q  http://www.your.website.address/mrbs/emailreminders-final.php >/dev/null 2>&1
